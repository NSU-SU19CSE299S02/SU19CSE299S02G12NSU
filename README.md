**Project Idea:**

We are trying to build a Web Apps that will help people to find the best Bus for a specific road. For travelling from one place to another we always try to find best bus and best road. Our plan is to provide the best possible bus according to review and timing. And you always find the shortest and jam free road by using this portal.  And you can also get combination of bus if there any need of multiple bus. You can book your ticket and make payment through a secure payment service.

**Features:**

<br>

**A)	Problem it will solve:**

We always wanted to know more about roads condition and which bus will be best for me for a particular road. We always get confused because all bus didn’t give same service and not always fast enough to reach our destination on time. Sometimes we also need to know which bus will be more cost effective and which one is comfortable. For a specific destination there always several road to reach. It is important to know which road is faster, which road is more safe for our journey.\

**B)How it will solve**

We give more priority on a user review. A user can give review how was his journey with this bus but for confirmation user need to upload their ticket and timing.  By checking location of a bus we can track road their movement and trip data. By using this data we can provide our user best bus and road available.

**User Login:**

There will be three or four types of user login system. Like admin who will usually add bus and bus owner. Basically admins main job will be maintaining the whole website. Admin will approve bus owner and normal user. Bus owner can add their stuff for a specific bus or for whole company. Mainly user who gets the main benefit of this website 

**User Login:**

1. Sign Up
2. Sign In
3. Become an admin

**Categorywise Bus Selection:**

When someone search for a bus they can filter their search like most affordable to luxurious, which one is time consuming and which one is faster. User can select one by one.

**Review:**

A user can give review of a road or a Bus.  This will put a huge impact on bus service. When searching a bus one will easily get the most rated bus and can read all reviews about this bus. The system will accept a bus review when user can upload bus ticket image.

**•	Ticket Booking:**

Bus ticket booking system is usually become easier. By a SSL secure payment system one can book their ticket by Bkash , Rocket , Paypal and Credit card.

**Sharing:**

Sharing a trip with a friend will be more enjoyable. You can invite your friend to join your trip. Also where safety is issue you can share your location and trip information with your familiar person.
**Technology:**

Giving more priority in user experience and user interface. Our plan is to make eye-catching  online portal using Javascript  with the help  of Node.js and Express.js .We will use google map API for best experience. And we will also create greedy algorithm for searching a bus and its route. For frontend we will use html5,css3,Jquery,Bootstrap . For database our plan is to use SQL Database. We will use PHP for connection.
**Business Plan:**

Our business plan will be unique. Giving opportunity for authority of a bus to promote their features and sell tickets. User can also get benefit with this web portal as they can get authentic reviews and always know about bus service and offers as well.
